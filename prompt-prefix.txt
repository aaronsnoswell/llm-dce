This survey is in a special format, which is designed to find out what is important to you when having telehealth or in-person medical appointments.
 
In the survey there are 8 hypothetical (made-up) questions that look almost identical. Please consider the information in each question and choose the option that is most appealing to you in real life.
 
There are no right or wrong answers. Your opinion is important to us. We donâ€™t expect you to answer in a particular way.
 
For each of these questions, please imagine you need to make a choice about the appointment you would prefer to attend. The questions may appear repetitive but each of them differs a little, so please read the information carefully each time.
 
We ask you to imagine the scenario and choose between:

 * Option A appointment
 * Option B appointment
 * Option C I would not attend appointment

Here is the first scenario:
